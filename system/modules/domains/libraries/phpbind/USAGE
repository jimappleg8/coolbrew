class.bind8.php works in the following way:

1) We declare a class from BindNS, with a domain name.
2) If we do not use a domain name in declaring a class we may do so now
by calling initialize() with the domain name.  Otherwise we can overload
functions and replace global variables.
3) We can call named() to get us a list of hosts (not zones!) currently
in named.conf.
4) We call initialize() with the domain name.
5) We change/add/delete values in the domain.
6) We call activate() or activare("delete").  To add or delete the domain
from named.conf.
