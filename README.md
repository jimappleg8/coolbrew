# coolbrew
Coolbrew is an open-source PHP framework that makes it easy to add dynamic content to all your websites.

Coolbrew was built for use with static websites and uses a tag-based architecture. The idea is that you can create dynamic parts for your website (or multiple websites) in Coolbrew and inject them into a static website using simple PHP functions calls that return HTML. In that way, they're similar in concept to Wordpress Shortcodes.
